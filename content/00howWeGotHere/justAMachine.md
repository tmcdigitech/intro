From EDVAC to today's laptops, smartphones, supercomputers and embedded systems
has been an extraordinary journey, and modern computers run at astonishing speed
compared with EDVAC, let alone the earlier computers, or Babbage's Analytical
Engine, had it been completed.

But even with all of this development, every computer is still just a machine.
It doesn't think for itself. It performs a specific set of instructions set out
for it. There is nothing intelligent about it. In the same way that you never
thought to marvel at the smarts of the chainsaw doing the sculpting, you should
never marvel at the achievements of a computer either. It is the people who
design the computers, and the people who design and write the programs they run,
who deserve to be marvelled at.

And modern computers are still just glorified calculators. Mostly what they do
is basic arithmetic. Loads and loads of it.

Modern computers may still be as unthinking as its earliest mechanical predecessors,
and still only capable of basic arithmetic, but they are unbelievably quick.
And modern software, whether operating systems, web browsers or games, can be
phenomenally large and complex. And that combination of complexity and speed is
what makes modern computers appear so amazing. But it still takes good old human
ingenuity to make a computer do anything. And that is where you come in...
