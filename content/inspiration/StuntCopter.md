Part of the genius of this game is how simple it is.
Your aim is to drop people out of a helicopter onto
the cart, carefully avoiding the rider and the horse.
The further up you drop from, the more points you
get. See what happens when you drop someone through
the clouds...

If you go to `Options > OffScreen` in the menu, you
can also see the complete sprite sheet for the game;
a nice touch.
