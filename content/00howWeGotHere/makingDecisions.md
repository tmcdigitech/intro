In 1837, Babbage described and began work on the [Analytical Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine).
It would be the world's first computer, in the modern sense of the word. Sadly, he never completed it, and we're not
entirely sure of all of the details of its design, so we haven't been able to recreate it (as happened in 1991 with
Babbage's *Difference Engine No. 2*).

The critical improvement over the Difference Engine was that the Analytical Engine was able to change what would be
done next based on certain values in the engine. In other words, while the series of instructions it was given
might be the same from one run of the program to the next, the *actual* series of steps it performed would differ
depending on the input it received.

In 1941 in Germany, Konrad Zuse completed the [Z3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer)) (originally known as the V3),
the world's first working programmable, fully automatic digital computer.
While the original was destroyed in 1943 during the Allied bombardment of Berlin,
a fully functioning replica was built in 1961 and is now on permanent display at the
[Deutsches Museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsches_Museum) in Munich.

In 1943 in the UK, Tommy Flowers completed [Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer),
the first fully electronic computer, used to break the Germans' Lorenz codes.
Ten Colossus machines were built and used extensively in the last 16 months of the war in Europe. The Colossus machines were
classified as military secrets and their existence was not publicly divulged until the 1970s, by which time all ten had been
destroyed. In 1993 a team began the construction of a fully functional Mark 2 Colossus, led by Tony Sale. Completed in 2008,
the rebuild is now exhibited at The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, where the original Colossuses all saw
service.

In 1945, the United States completed [ENIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENIAC), the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer,
which was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer. But it was its successor,
[EDVAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDVAC), completed in 1949, which completed the spiritual transition to the
computers of today. EDVAC was the first computer to store its program internally, along with its data, meaning
it was the first computer capable of changing its own program. Now the modern computer was complete.
