Here is a more complex machine. This is a [Jacquard loom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacquard_machine). 
The loom itself had long existed to weave fabric, and had been evolved considerably over the centuries
to allow the production of much larger and patterned woven material, but it was still extremely slow,
even for simple patterns, and making patterns required at least two people to operate the machine.
In 1804, Joseph Marie Jacquard invented a machine to automate the pattern controls. Now even the
most complex of patterns could be made much more quickly,
and with only one operator controlling the entire loom.

This is the earliest example of a programmable machine, and the idea of storing data and instructions
on punched cards, chained together, was a key invention in the development of the modern computer.
