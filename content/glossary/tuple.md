A tuple is a single unit of data made up of multiple values. In Python they are defined using round brackets, with commas separating the values. Tuples can contain all sorts of data as values, but in Pygame Zero we use them most often for [colors]({{< relref "/glossary/color" >}}) `(red, green, blue)` and [co-ordinates]({{< relref "/glossary/coordinate" >}}) `(x, y)`.
