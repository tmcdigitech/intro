Below is a picture of a person making a sculpture with a chainsaw. When you admire the sculpture,
you don't think *what an impressive chainsaw*, because it's a chainsaw. It's a machine.
It's just does what it does. It is the person who has caused the impressiveness to happen.
It's the person wielding it who deserves the credit.
