Here is a checklist of things to look for if something is wrong...

## Spelling and Capitalisation

**Remember that the computer is really, really, really, really *stupid***. It will recognise only words it has been taught; it is not clever enough to handle spelling mistakes - these will confuse it. It is also not clever enough to know that most of the time we use `A` and `a` interchangeably, so you have to make sure that if the computer is expecting a capital letter, you give it one, and vice versa.
