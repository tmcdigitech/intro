title: color/colour
---
In almost all programming, American spellings are used. So as programmers we use **colors**, even though we would normally spell the word **colours**.

For most programming, colors are described by the amount of red, green, and blue light to emit. These numbers are normally in the range 0-255. In Pygame Zero, we list these as a tuple `(red, green, blue)`, such as:

```python
(0, 150, 255)
```
You can use the [Google Color Picker](https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker) to find different colors, and then copy the RGB value listed.
