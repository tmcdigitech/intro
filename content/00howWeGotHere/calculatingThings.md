The [abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abacus) has been around since ancient times. It continues to
be used as a tool to perform calculations, particularly in some parts of Eastern Europe, Russia, China and Africa.

In the mid 1600s, [Blaise Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaise_Pascal) developed the first reliably
working [mechanical calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Calculator), capable of
automatic addition and subtraction. The user could use it for
multiplication and division by use of repeated addition and subtraction.

In 1822, [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) completed his
[Difference Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine), which could automatically compute
not just addition and subtraction, but also multiplacation, division and square roots and, because it could calculate
polynomials, accurate approximations of logarithmic and trigonometric functions. Entire tables of values could
be calculated with just turns of a crank.
