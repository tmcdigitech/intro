title: Phrase Craze
---
*by Brad Pettit (1986)*

Borrowing heavily from the TV game show
*Wheel of Fortune*, Phrase Craze offers up to four
players the chance to relive the thrill of being on
the set, complete with game board, wheel, and
charming host. You could also modify the PhraseFile
to create your own puzzles.
