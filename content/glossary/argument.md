title: argument
---

When *calling* a function, the values given to it are called *arguments*. For example, in this case:

```python
total = add(3, 4)
```

`3` and `4` are arguments to the function `add()`.

When *defining* a function, the pieces of information that the function takes to do its job are called [parameters]({{< ref "/glossary/parameter" >}}).
