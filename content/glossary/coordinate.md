title: co-ordinate system
---
In most programming environments (such as Pygame Zero), the screen co-ordinate system uses `(x, y)` co-ordinates, with the origin `(0, 0)` in the top left corner of the screen, with `x` to the right, and `y` going down.

Everything to be displayed on the screen must be *rastered*, which means rendered into a grid of colored pixels.
