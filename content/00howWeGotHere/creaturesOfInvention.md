Humans have been using tools for millenia, and we've been making machines for centuries.

Every time we develop a new tool or a new machine, it allows us to do something faster,
or safer, or more efficiently and, occasionally, sometimes it allows us to do something
entirely new. Something that was impractical or impossible before. Something impossible
like spending hours underwater, making and distributing electricity, reading in our
late age and after the sun goes down, travelling for hours at horse-like speeds or better,
or flying through the air.
