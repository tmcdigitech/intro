title: Iago
---
*by David Reed (1984)*

Iago was a very early Othello/Reversi game, which
offered excellent gameplay. You could play against
a friend or a computer with three levels of
difficulty, on three different sizes of board.

It even has a special feature to hide the game if
you are playing it at work and your boss is coming...
